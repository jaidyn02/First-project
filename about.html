<h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>My name is Jaidyn Moore and this website is the very first website I have created and i'm going to keep on trying to improve
    it as i'm learning how to do certain things when making a website and the best way to do it. This is just for school work.
  nothing more. The reason the website shows random things is just for the lessons as well so please if you find this dont make 
    any crazy theories about why the site exists.<p/>
