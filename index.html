    <h1>lions</h1>
	<p> Lions otherwise known as panthera leo is a species of big cats that live in Africa, India, and The democratic
	republic of Congo. They usally live up to ten to fourteen years, and the male lions defend the area while the females
	hunt for prey.	Another difference between the males and the females is that the male lions have a bunch of hair
	around the head and neck called a mane.	The species population is slowly decreasing and enviromentalists are
		trying to come up with ways to stop this and bring the species back up.</p>
